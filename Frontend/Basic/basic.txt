1. HTML -->
    Index : It's important when we make a website the first or important page and .html is an extension.
    Boilerplate Code : That code which we willhave to write necessarily 
        <!Doctype> --> Version of HTML 5
        <html></html>  --> Acts as a wrapper coupled up the head and body tags
        <meta> Instruction
        <title> It's for the title
        Content comes from the body tag <body></body>

    h1-h6, p, b, li, ul, ol, sup, sub, 
    Anchor Tag, Img , video, div -> use to make a rectangle and to make use of it for to store something,By default the div has width but not height if we don't give any width and height,  id # , class . --> to differentiate the elements based on the names , All the ids can't repeat their names but all the class can have the same name.

    Kai baar tags ko dekh kar yeh nahi bataya jaa sakhta ki aap exactly kya bananewalle ho iss cheiz ko kaffi haq tak solve karta hai html5 semantics.

2. CSS :

    Cascading style sheet
    box --> div
width and height
Color, Backgroundcolor
Units - 
    Px : DPI -> Depthper inch (Retina dislpay or ULtraHD) , PPI (Pixel per inch) => Px varies from computer to computer desktop. We make less use of px as it gives a scroller as we can't rely much on it due to less responsiveness,
    % : The total screen of some value like from 100%-50% = 50% The % value takes the value from the Parent ,
    vh : ,
    vw : ,   => The vh and vw takes the value from the screen

    rem : It depends upon the html font-size. Rem (Root emperial Unit),

    em : Itdepends on the elements size, agar aap yeh parent ko dete hai toh children par bhi apply hotta hai. Matlab kuch aisa aek element hai box jiske pass 16px font-size hai toh 1em ki value 16px hoggi aur agar font change hua toh em ki value bhi change hoggi. And 1em value = 16px, 

    Max-width/Max-Height : It's like a hook if we try to push above that limit it will not exceed above that. For example : test width is 500px and test value is 1200px the test value will not go above 500px value of test as max-width is set to be 500px,
    It will not exceed above that value or after that value. Limit lag jaat hai ussae upar nahi jayega.
    
    Min-width/ Min-height : It will set the hook as yeh itni minimum value kae upar hi rahegae sabh elements. This is the minimum value all the elements 

Font-family : Changing the font style
    -> This are of two types :
        (a) Serif : Have sharp edges Example : playfair display , 
        (b) Sans Serif : No sharp edge is present  Example : Montserrat.

Font-size : Changing the font sizes
Line-height : 
text-align :
padding : Applied from the parent
margin : 
border : width style Color,
display : 
border-radius
position : 
    (a) Absolute --> It levetates as per the layer depending upon the elem positions, 
    (b) Relative --> It controls the absolute position element as a parent or respectively with the relative the absolute follows
    (c) Fixed

background :
    -> Color : Lineargradient(todirection, color1, color2)  // todirection as : to right bottom, to right top, etc...

    -> url for an image
    -> Background-size : cover,
    -> Background-position : center,
    -> Background-image 

flexbox :
    -> It's applied on the parents 
    -> Two access are activated
    -> X and Y axis
    -> X axis as Main-axis and Y-axis as Cross-axis
    -> Justify-content for the main axis X-axis and Align-items for the Cross-axis Y-axis.


--> Har element kae pass aek possibility hotti hai ki wou element chahe toh inactive doo after and before property ko activate karsakhta hai. 

pseudo-elements : 
    ::before
    ::after
    ::first-Line
    ::first-letter
    ::selection

pseudo-classes : 
    :hover
    :active
    :focus
    :nth-child(n)


Color Theory : 
    -> Our screen shows mainly three screen. It has been made up from many led screens, And everyone of them can show three colors and combination of those three colors.
    -> In css every color has minimum value 0 and maximum value 255.
    -> R=255, G=255, B=255 => White light on full intensity of every color
    -> R=0, G=0, B=0 => Black color on low intensity of every color.

    -> Hexadecimal code : #
    -> Rgb 
    -> Rgba (r,g,b,transperancy or opacity)
    -> Hsl (Hue, Saturation, light)
