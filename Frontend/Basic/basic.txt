1. HTML -->
    Index : It's important when we make a website the first or important page and .html is an extension.
    Boilerplate Code : That code which we willhave to write necessarily 
        <!Doctype> --> Version of HTML 5
        <html></html>  --> Acts as a wrapper coupled up the head and body tags
        <meta> Instruction
        <title> It's for the title
        Content comes from the body tag <body></body>

    h1-h6, p, b, li, ul, ol, sup, sub, 
    Anchor Tag, Img , video, div -> use to make a rectangle and to make use of it for to store something,By default the div has width but not height if we don't give any width and height,  id # , class . --> to differentiate the elements based on the names , All the ids can't repeat their names but all the class can have the same name.

    Kai baar tags ko dekh kar yeh nahi bataya jaa sakhta ki aap exactly kya bananewalle ho iss cheiz ko kaffi haq tak solve karta hai html5 semantics.

2. CSS :

    Cascading style sheet
    box --> div
width and height
Color, Backgroundcolor
Units - 
    Px : DPI -> Depthper inch (Retina dislpay or ULtraHD) , PPI (Pixel per inch) => Px varies from computer to computer desktop. We make less use of px as it gives a scroller as we can't rely much on it due to less responsiveness,
    % : The total screen of some value like from 100%-50% = 50% The % value takes the value from the Parent ,
    vh : ,
    vw : ,   => The vh and vw takes the value from the screen

    rem : It depends upon the html font-size. Rem (Root emperial Unit),

    em : Itdepends on the elements size, agar aap yeh parent ko dete hai toh children par bhi apply hotta hai. Matlab kuch aisa aek element hai box jiske pass 16px font-size hai toh 1em ki value 16px hoggi aur agar font change hua toh em ki value bhi change hoggi. And 1em value = 16px, 

    Max-width/Max-Height : It's like a hook if we try to push above that limit it will not exceed above that. For example : test width is 500px and test value is 1200px the test value will not go above 500px value of test as max-width is set to be 500px,
    It will not exceed above that value or after that value. Limit lag jaat hai ussae upar nahi jayega.
    
    Min-width/ Min-height : It will set the hook as yeh itni minimum value kae upar hi rahegae sabh elements. This is the minimum value all the elements 

Font-family : Changing the font style
    -> This are of two types :
        (a) Serif : Have sharp edges Example : playfair display , 
        (b) Sans Serif : No sharp edge is present  Example : Montserrat.

Font-size : Changing the font sizes
Line-height : 
text-align :
padding : Applied from the parent
margin : 
border : width style Color,
display : 
border-radius
position : 
    (a) Absolute --> It levetates as per the layer depending upon the elem positions, 
    (b) Relative --> It controls the absolute position element as a parent or respectively with the relative the absolute follows
    (c) Fixed

background :
    -> Color : Lineargradient(todirection, color1, color2)  // todirection as : to right bottom, to right top, etc...

    -> url for an image
    -> Background-size : cover,
    -> Background-position : center,
    -> Background-image 

flexbox :
    -> It's applied on the parents 
    -> Two access are activated
    -> X and Y axis
    -> X axis as Main-axis and Y-axis as Cross-axis
    -> Justify-content for the main axis X-axis and Align-items for the Cross-axis Y-axis.


--> Har element kae pass aek possibility hotti hai ki wou element chahe toh inactive doo after and before property ko activate karsakhta hai. 

pseudo-elements : 
    ::before
    ::after
    ::first-Line
    ::first-letter
    ::selection

pseudo-classes : 
    :hover
    :active
    :focus
    :nth-child(n)


Color Theory : 
    -> Our screen shows mainly three screen. It has been made up from many led screens, And everyone of them can show three colors and combination of those three colors.
    -> In css every color has minimum value 0 and maximum value 255.
    -> R=255, G=255, B=255 => White light on full intensity of every color
    -> R=0, G=0, B=0 => Black color on low intensity of every color.

    -> Hexadecimal code : #
    -> Rgb 
    -> Rgba (r,g,b,transperancy or opacity)
    -> Hsl (Hue, Saturation, light)

animation
media queries





##javascript :
    -> Created by Branden Eigg
    -> Unwanted things or error 
    -> In intial js was known as moca
    -> script.src
    -> Declaration : var a;
    -> Initialization : a=10;
    -> / quotient (10/5=2)
    -> % remainder (10%5 = 0)
    -> ALert - For message, Confirm('Are you there?'), prompt("Enter name : )
    -> let and const use for variable making

   (1) Js the language :
    => Managed by ecmascript community (overall development of js.)
    => Code likhna seekhna 

    -> Basics : file connection and execution
    -> Inbuilt Features : log, warn, error, Confirm, prompt
    -> Variables Constant : 
        -> Har programming language mein data saw deal karna hota hai wou alag alag prakar ka data ho sakhtta hai. tou wou data save karne ke liye hume koi saving space chahiye jaha par data save hojaaye and yeh save karne ke liye unnhe kuch naam bhi denna padega.And esiliye humme variables and constants bannae padte hai taaki data save hojaye and unka koi naam bhi hotaaki hum unhe baadmae access karsakhte hai. 
        -> When we run the code like js will run in chrome or browser but it keeps some storage to store the data known as Google Chrome Storage. 
        -> But it indirectly stores in RAM.
        -> Whatever u runs on computer systems it runs on ram.
        -> Variables can store and change it values again. But, const takes the values but doesn't changes it again.
        -> And both takes some place on the browser memory and browser runs on ram then technically both runs on ram or takes space in ram.


    -> Compilers and interpreter :
        => Compiler : Task run slow, but run fast
        => interpreter : Task run fast, but run slow
        => Js language english words use karti hai and computers english nahi samajhte they understand current flow(1) and current bypass (0) 
        => SO we use translattor that will take code in english and convert it into 0 & 1.
        => Compiler and interpreter are the translator.
        => Compiler converts the english code into machine code (task run slow, fast run)
        => Interpreter converts the code into Byte code (less hardware, Fast conversion rate but slow run)
        => Javascript is an interpreted language 
        => It uses JIT (Just In Time Compiler) -> It uses the early power of interpreter that the fast conversion rate and compiler running strength

    -> Window :
        => It is a collection of tools that browser offers to use in JS.
        => There are many features that are frequently used in JS and they are not the part of JS, but they are available in the browser. But when we use them in JS they are called from the browser not the JS.

    
    -> Types and Data Types :
            => pop, .spread operator 
            [...arrayname]
        (a) Primitive Data types :
            => Number (23, 23.5, 24.55)
            => String ('a', "Om")
            => Boolean (true or false)
            => Undefined
            => Null
            => Symbol
            => BigInt


        (b) Reference Data types : [], {}, ()
            => Arrays
            => Functions
            => Objects

                


    -> Conditionals :

            -> if(condition is true){ } else{}
            -> else if(){} else{}
            -> Ternary Operator : condition() ? () : ();
                = (12>11) ? console.log('Hii') : console.log('heyy');
            -> Switch : switch(value){ case value:  //code   break;  case value:  //code  break;  default :  //code}
                = 

                Truthy and falsy :  null, undefined, '' , " ", 0, NaN, document.all => Falsy or false rest all are Truthy.

    -> Loops : 
        for, while, do-while, foreach, forin and forof   

        for(Initialization; condition; updation){
        } 
        for(start; end; change){}

            =for(let i = 0; i<=5; i++){ console.log(i);}

        While loop : initialization at the begining, condition at the bracket and updation at the inner code
        let v = 21;
        while(){
            //code
        }

        let i = 1;
        while(i<=10){
            i++;
            log(i);
        }

        do-while :

        do{
            log
            i++;
        }
        while(11<12)


        -> foreach() : yeh ek normal loop nahi hai jo numners pe ya start aur end par chalta hai , forEach loop sirf array pae chalta hai 

        -> break (stop) and continue (skip at that elem)




    -> Functions :
    => Es5 and ES6
    => Es5 : Functions statement, function expression, anonymous Functions 
    => ES6 : Fat arrow function : (a) Basic fat arrow function, (c) Fat arrow function with implicit return, (b) fat arrow function with one paramter.
    => Js is a first class function
    => Js does not involves type naming of the function
    => What is functions : Koi aisa code jou aapko baar baar use karna ho, ya fir koi aisa code jisko turant na chalana ho par kabhi chalana ho, usey function mae daal sakhte ho.
    => why we need functions :  To reuse, to wrap the code which we  want to run the code in future at some point of time.

    => Syntax :
        function abd(){

        } 
        abcd();

        => Parameter and arguments : The parameters are the variables that accept the value from the arguments. And the arguments are the one which passes the values to the arguments.

        *ES5 =>
        (1) Function statement : function abd(){ //Function statement } abd();
        (2) Function expression : let abd = function cbd(){ Function expression } cbd();
        (3) Function anonymous : function(){Anonymous function}

        *ES6 =>
        (1) Simple Fat arrow function : var a = () => {}; var bb = () => {}
        (2) Fat arrow function with one Parameter : let bb = (ag) => {} bb(12);
        (3) Fat arrow function with implicit return : let abcd = ()=> 34;   abcd(); //number, true, array, "om"

    -> return : The code runs on the series od line of code and when a function runs it returns whatever will go to from where it was started  ex: suppose for example line 42 it will return there again. from where the functions where called.

    function abcd(){
        return 12;
    }
    let ans = abcd();

    why functions always return something in js : functions always return something when we don't define anything something is exist. Then it is the notdefined.
    let a = (bb) => 12; let ans = a();

    -> Undefined, Not defined, Null :
        Undefined : Is a value (No value)
        Not defined : Is an error  (No Declaration)
        Null : Is also a value. (No value is been given or found)


    -> Arrays : 
        => What : Aek yah ek sae jyada values ko saath mae rakhna ho 
        let users = ["Om" , " " , " "]

        => How : let arr = [0, "om", 'String']; arr(1);  //0 indexing

        => why : A lot of times the data is in the shape of more than one values to contain all together that's when array is used.

    -> Looping with Arrays : 

        //How to loop an array and do something with each

        arr.foreach(function(val){

        })

    -> Objects :

    => Specific elem data or a lot of data all at once.

    let obj = {}
    let obj2 = new Object();
    let obj = {
        name: "om";
    }


    -> Synchronous and asynchronous JS :

    => Js runs in main stack and side stack.
    =>When the code runs where some of the lines of codes are sync and async code.
    => The sync code goes into main stack when it is play or executed properly in main stack

    * Synchronous JS : 
        => Follows line of code and execution
        => The sync code goes into main stack when it is play or executed properly in main stack
        => The main stack become empty and it's executed properly

    * ASynchronous JS :
        => Doesn't follow lines of code follows as per the execution of the first like all of the code start at once and as per the finishing of the code of line that answer is provided.
        => The async code goes into Sidesctack for the execution of the code.
        => When it is executed it will be passed on to the main stack when the main stack is empty
        => And the side stack becomes empty and enters the main stack and executed properly and main stack becomes empty and we get the output.
        

    -> ES6 climax

    -> this, call, apply, bind :

        => this : this keyword js mein bohot hi suspensefull keyword(let, var, for, while, const, etc) hai. this ki value baar baar badal sakhti hai alag alag condition mein, saari conditions ko sikh jao toh this ki value samajh jaogae

                        -> let heading1 = document.getElementById('#topkatext');
                    (b) document.getElementByClassName
                        -> let heading2 = document.getElementByClassName('.topkatext2');
                    (c) document.getElementByTagName
                        -> let heading = document.getElementByTagName('h1');


                        Question :
                            (1) Create two images in HTML and two h3 and select all of them this way:
                                give first image some id and second image a class. give first h3 a class and select the last h3 with id.

// Agar aapke pass bohot saare h3 hai and aap select karte ho toh sirf pehla walla h3 select hoga.

            (b) Modifying Elements : Kisiko bhi change karne sae pehle usse select karna hota hai.
            Textcontent => for changing the text of an elem.
            InnerHtml => FOr tags using or like italic it will show the text with italic style. but in the case of Textcontent it will just show as text.

            (c) Manipulating style and classes :
            for individual elem use as style.color = "";
            for using the class for styling we can use classList as .classList.add('makeitfontss');

            (d) Creating and Deleting Element :
                1. createElement() :  to create a element and we can use it by appendchild() where we want to store it in the body and what to store
                document.queryselector("body").appendchild(h1);
                removechild(); 

            (e) Events Handling :
                -> jabh bhi aap kisis elem pae kisi bhi prakar ka koi action karte ho to waha par event by default automatically raise hota hai agar apnae koi event listener na lagay ho to wou event ignore krdiya jaata hai par agar aapne listener banaya hai toh uss event par toh wou event ignore nahi kiya jayaega balki uska listenere chalega.
